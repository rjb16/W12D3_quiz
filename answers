1) What does the word 'polymorphism' mean? 
-Multiple forms
2)What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
-It means an object can be multiple things.For example a Tesla is an instance of the car class, but it is also a vehicle.
3)What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
-We can use inheritance. Any object that satisfies more than one IS-A relationship is polymorphic,we can also use interfaces.
4)How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism? 
-It depends on how we achieve polymorphism. An object of a class, can only inherit from one other superclass, but there are no limits how many interfaces
a class can implement.
5)Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
-Polymorphism allows a loose coupling of components and therefore makes the code more reusable. We could use it when we have an ArrayList.
ArrayLists can only store items of one single type. If we wanted to store dogs, birds and cats in one ArrayList, we can do that by using polymorphism and creating a parent class called animal.
Dogs, birds and cats are sub-classes of animal and if we create an ArrayList we can store these instances of the different sub-classes in there.

6)What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming? 
-The object is part of a class.
7)When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
-An engine object is part of the car class. The engine cannot exist without the car.
8)Give a difference between composition and aggregation?
-A difference between composition and aggregation is that with composition the different parts of the class dont exist outside of the class.
9)What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation? 
-It increases the re-useability of the code.
10)When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
-They also get destroyed
11)When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
They still exist. If a car gets destroyed, we can remove the engine and use it in a different car.
